## Phase 1: Design and Build the Database  

### Introduction

The **Bus Company Management System** is designed to efficiently oversee the operations of a public transportation organization. This system ensures seamless coordination between different divisions, including fleet management, employee assignments, route scheduling, ticketing, finance, and customer support.

#### Purpose of the Database
This database serves as a structured and reliable solution for bus company operations by:
- **Managing the fleet through** detailed tracking of buses, maintenance records, fuel consumption and inspections.
- **Organizing driver and staff assignments,** ensuring proper scheduling and payroll management.
- **Optimizing route planning and scheduling** to improve operational efficiency and passenger service.  
- **Handling ticketing and booking,** allowing passengers to reserve seats and track ticket purchases.
- **Maintaining financial records,** including revenue, expenses, and tax reporting.
- **Providing customer support,** allowing for complaint tracking, lost-and-found management and feedback collection.

#### Potential Use Cases
- **Fleet Managers** can track bus maintenance, fuel logs and inspections to ensure operational efficiency. 
- **Drivers and Staff** can view their schedules, salary details and attendance records.
- **Passengers** can book tickets, view schedules, and submit feedback or complaints.
- **Customer Support Representatives** can manage inquiries, complaints and lost-and-found items.

This structured database enhances operational efficiency, financial tracking and customer satisfaction, making it an essential tool for managing large-scale bus transportation services.
